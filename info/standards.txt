I've tried to not be too hard on this, but I'm a bit OCD when it comes to naming convetions. Also it will help be
consistent in our code, and make searching for things easier.

-File/Directory Naming
	- NO WHITE SPACES
	- no underscores
	- use lower camelCase e.g. myNewFileIsThisName.txt

-Code
	- functions
		- see File Naming for naming
		- name a function based on what it does e.g. isConnected(), voertmansStatus()
		- put start curly bracket on line below function name
	- variables
		- see File Naming for naming
		- name a varible so it's clear what it's holding e.g. totalPrice, bookPrice
